## Overview

Congratulations on successfully integrating with Parchment Health APIs! This guide outlines the essential steps to transition from development to production, ensuring a smooth deployment for your users.

<Info>
  **Timeline**: The entire process from video submission to production launch typically takes 3-5 business days, depending on the complexity of your integration and review feedback.

## Step 1: Integration Demonstration Video

Once you're satisfied with your development integration, you'll need to create a comprehensive demonstration video showing the complete user journey.

### üìπ Video Requirements

Your demonstration video must cover the following workflow in order:

#### 1.1 Credentials Setup
- Navigate to **Settings > Organisation > Edit > Partner Integrations** in your development environment
- Copy the partner credentials (organisation_id, organisation_secret and user_id)
- **Note**: You don't need to blur out the credentials as it's a developer environment 

#### 1.2 PMS Integration Configuration
- Open your Practice Management System (PMS)
- Navigate to the Parchment integration settings
- Enter the development credentials you copied
- Save the configuration

#### 1.3 Integration Validation
- Return to Parchment's integration page
- Refresh the page if you need to
- **Demonstrate**: The integration tile turning **green** ‚úÖ (this confirms the `/validate` endpoint is working correctly)
- Show any success messages or status indicators

#### 1.4 Patient Workflow Demonstration
- Create a **new** patient in PMS (you need to use test data for the xls doc shared previously)
- Click the prescription button in PMS
- **Demonstrate**: The user is taken to the patient in Parchment

#### 1.5 Prescription Management
- Create a prescription for the patient in Parchment 
- **Demonstrate**: The prescription data is correctly displayed in PMS

### üìù Video Best Practices

<Tip>
  - **Duration**: Keep the video between 5-15 minutes
  - **Resolution**: Record in at least 1080p for clarity
  - **Audio**: Include clear narration explaining each step
  - **Format**: MP4 or MOV format preferred
  - **Security**: Blur any real patient data or sensitive information
</Tip>

## Step 2: Video Review Process

### 2.1 Submission
Submit your demo video through one of the following methods:
- **Preferred**: Upload to a secure sharing platform (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) and share the link
- **Alternative**: Direct email attachment (if file size permits)

### 2.2 Review Timeline
<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Review">
    **1-2 business days** - Technical review of integration functionality
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feedback Round">
    **1 business day** - Any issues or questions communicated back to you
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final Approval">
    **1 business day** - Approval for production credentials once all requirements are met
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Production Credentials & Security

### 3.1 Security Assessment

Before receiving production credentials, we need to understand your security practices:

#### Required Information:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Credential Storage & Access">
    **We need to know:**
    - How production API credentials will be stored (environment variables, secure vault, etc.)
    - Which team members/roles will have access to these credentials
    - Your authorized user's security posture (MFA enabled etc)
    - Whether credentials will be stored in version control (should be **NO**)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Infrastructure Security">
    **Please provide details on:**
    - Server security measures and access controls
    - Network security (VPNs, firewalls, etc.)
    - Data encryption practices (in transit and at rest)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compliance & Monitoring">
    **Documentation needed for:**
    - HIPAA compliance measures (if applicable)
    - Audit logging and monitoring systems
    - Incident response procedures
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3.2 Authorized Personnel

Provide the **email address** and **role** of the person who will:
- Receive the production credentials securely
- Be responsible for credential management
- Serve as the primary technical contact for production issues


### 3.3 Secure Credential Delivery

Production credentials will be delivered via:
- **1Password** that will be sent to authorised user's email and expires in 7 days, or
- **Secure Email** if you have a preferred solution we could use

<Warning>
  **Never** share production credentials via unencrypted channels (Slack, SMS, regular email, etc.)
</Warning>

## Step 4: Production Launch

### 4.1 Integration Tile Activation

- Your integration tile will be made **live** in Parchment's production environment
- You'll receive email confirmation when the tile is active

  </Step>
  <Step title="Integration Setup">
    Navigate to Settings > Integrations and find your PMS tile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credential Entry">
    Copy credentials into your PMS
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Test the connection (tile should turn green)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Prescribing">
    Begin using Parchment for electronic prescriptions (once prescriber details have been validated)
  </Step>
</Steps>
