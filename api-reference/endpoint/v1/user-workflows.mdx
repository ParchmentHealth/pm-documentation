## Upgrading a User to Prescriber

A common scenario is creating a user with basic access and later upgrading them to have prescriber capabilities. This workflow shows how to transform an `rx_reader` into a `provider` with full prescriber details.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create User with Basic Access">
    Start by creating a user with the `rx_reader` role for basic prescription reading access.

    ```json
    POST /v1/organizations/{organizationId}/users
    {
      "given_name": "Ben",
      "family_name": "Smith",
      "email": "user-email@my-practice.com",
      "access_roles": ["rx_reader"]
    }
    ```

    <Info>
      The `rx_reader` role allows users to view and read prescriptions but not create them.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update User Roles">
    Upgrade the user's access level by changing their role to `provider`.

    ```json
    PUT /v1/organizations/{organizationId}/users/{userId}/roles
    {
      "access_roles": ["provider"]
    }
    ```

    <Warning>
       Adding a `provider` role -> switching to non `provider` role -> then switching back to `provider` role may cause issues due to dependencies on downstream third party services
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Provider Details">
    Complete the provider setup by adding professional details and prescriber information.

    ```json
    PUT /v1/organizations/{organizationId}/users/{userId}
    {
      "provider_details": {
        "given_name": "Ben",
        "family_name": "Smith",
        "date_of_birth": "1975-12-25",
        "sex": "M",
        "phone": "0432333333",
        "hpii_number": "8003614900000000",
        "prescriber_type": "M",
        "prescriber_number": "1234567",
        "qualifications": "MD"
      }
    }
    ```

    <Info>
      **Required Provider Fields:**
      - `hpii_number`: Healthcare Provider Identifier Individual number
      - `prescriber_type`: Prescriber type (M/N/D/P/T) 
      - `prescriber_number`: Unique prescriber identification number
      - `qualifications`: Professional qualifications (MD, RN, etc.)
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Other Common Workflows

### Creating a Provider from Scratch

If you know the user will be a provider from the beginning:

```json
POST /v1/organizations/{organizationId}/users
{
  "given_name": "Sarah",
  "family_name": "Johnson",
  "email": "sarah.johnson@clinic.com",
  "access_roles": ["provider"],
  "date_of_birth": "1980-03-15",
  "sex": "F",
  "phone": "0455666777",
  "hpii_number": "8003614900000001",
  "prescriber_type": "M",
  "prescriber_number": "2345678",
  "qualifications": "MBBS"
}
```

### Downgrading Provider Access

To remove provider privileges while keeping basic access:

```json
PUT /v1/organizations/{organizationId}/users/{userId}/roles
{
  "access_roles": ["rx_reader"]
}
```

<Note>
  Provider details are retained when downgrading roles and can be reactivated by upgrading the role back to `provider`.
