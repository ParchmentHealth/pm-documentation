title: SSO Integration (generic)
---

Parchment Health supports **SAML 2.0-based Single Sign-On (SSO)**. This guide is for IT administrators or identity provider (IdP) teams who want to integrate with our platform to enable secure, seamless user authentication.

---

## Overview

- **Protocol**: SAML 2.0
- **Supported IdPs**: Any that support SAML 2.0 (e.g. Azure AD, Okta, Ping Identity, Google Workspace, etc.)
- **Flow**: SP-initiated login only

---

## SAML Configuration

Set up a new **SAML 2.0 application** in your identity provider with the following details:

### Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL

| Environment | ACS URL                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Development | `https://auth-dev.parchment.health/saml2/idpresponse` |
| Production  | `https://auth.parchment.health/saml2/idpresponse`     |

---

### Entity ID / Audience URI

| Environment | Entity ID (Audience URI)                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Development | `urn:amazon:cognito:sp:ap-southeast-2_Y1BbT5tQR` |
| Production  | Provided upon successful DEV environment testing |

> You can request your production Entity ID after testing is complete.

---

### Required Attributes

The following attributes must be included in the SAML assertion:

| Attribute Name | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `user_id`      | Unique user identifier (string) |
| `email`        | Email address                   |
| `name`         | Full name (first + last)        |
| `given_name`   | First name                      |
| `family_name`  | Last name                       |

> ⚠️ All attributes are **case-sensitive** and must be present in the SAML response.

## Send configuration to Parchment

Once you have configured the SAML integration, send the following to Parchment support:

- SAML metadata file (XML)

or

- SAML metadata URL

---

## Testing & Going Live

1. **Set up** the SAML integration using the development ACS URL and Entity ID.
2. **Test** SSO by initiating login from the Parchment platform.
3. Once successful, contact [hello@parchment.health](mailto:hello@parchment.health) to:
   - Confirm your test results
   - Receive your **production Entity ID**
   - Finalize production access
