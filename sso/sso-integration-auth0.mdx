description: "Integrate your Auth0 identity provider with Parchment Health using SAML 2.0"
---

## Integration Steps

To integrate your identity provider with Parchment using SAML:

1. **Request SSO Setup**: Contact Parchment support to initiate SSO setup for your organization
2. **Configure Your Identity Provider**:
   - Set up a new SAML application in your identity provider

### Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL

| Environment | ACS URL                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Development | `https://auth-dev.parchment.health/saml2/idpresponse` |
| Production  | `https://auth.parchment.health/saml2/idpresponse`     |

3. **Set Audience URI**:
   - For development: `urn:amazon:cognito:sp:ap-southeast-2_Y1BbT5tQR`
   - Production URI will be provided after testing is complete
4. **Configure Attribute Mapping**:
   - Map the following attributes from your identity provider to Parchment:
     - `user_id`
     - `email`
     - `name`
     - `given_name`
     - `family_name`
5. **Set Callback URLs**:
   - For development:
     ```
     https://auth-dev.parchment.health/saml2/idpresponse
     ```
   - For production:
     ```
     https://auth.parchment.health/saml2/idpresponse
     ```
6. **Test the Integration**:
   - Verify SSO login works in the development environment
   - Once confirmed, complete production deployment with Parchment support

## SAML Configuration Example (Auth0)

Here's an example configuration for Auth0:

```json
{
  "audience": "urn:amazon:cognito:sp:ap-southeast-2_Y1BbT5tQR",
  "mappings": {
    "user_id": "user_id",
    "email": "email",
    "name": "name",
    "given_name": "given_name",
    "family_name": "family_name"
  },
  "createUpnClaim": false,
  "passthroughClaimsWithNoMapping": false,
  "mapUnknownClaimsAsIs": false
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration:

1. Verify all endpoints and URIs are correctly configured
2. Ensure attribute mappings are properly set up in your identity provider
3. Check that your identity provider is correctly sending all required attributes
