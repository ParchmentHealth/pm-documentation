## API Scopes and Timeline

<Accordion title="What is the timeline for releasing additional API scopes?">
  We are currently testing the create user/prescriber endpoint and plan to
  launch it by the end of this month. Support for update and delete operations
  on patients and users is scheduled for release in July.
</Accordion>

## Patient Records

<Accordion title="What is the recommended approach to creating patient records?">
While it's technically possible to create patients at the time of prescribing, we recommend creating patient records in advance for two key reasons:

First, it avoids potential validation errors during the prescribing process.

Second, it reduces latency, as creating a new patient record on-the-fly may introduce a few seconds of delay.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are patient records shared across users within our organization?">
  Yes, patient records in Parchment are scoped to the organization (practice).
  All prescribers within a practice can access the same set of patient records,
  including those created by their colleagues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can we determine if a patient record already exists in Parchment via the API?">
  The API will return a response indicating whether the patient already exists
  in the system.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can we edit patient records via the API?">
  The ability to update patient records will be available in July.
</Accordion>

## Prescriptions and Access

<Accordion title="Can prescribers view each other's prescriptions within the same organization?">
  Yes, prescriptions created by any prescriber within the same organization will
  be visible to other prescribers in that organization.
</Accordion>

## Webhooks and Notifications

<Accordion title="Are there webhooks or callbacks available to notify us of events in Parchment?">
  We are planning to release webhook support by the end of June or early July to
  enable real-time notifications.
</Accordion>

## Production Access

<Accordion title="How will production credentials be shared with us?">
  Production credentials will be shared securely via 1Password or another secure
  method of your choice.
