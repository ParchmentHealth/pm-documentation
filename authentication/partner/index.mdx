## Overview

Parchment uses a multi-layered authentication approach for partners:

1. **Partner Registration** - Partners are registered in our system with a unique Partner ID.
2. **Organization Registration** - Each partner can have multiple organizations, each with their own credentials.
3. **Token Generation** - Partners can generate JWT tokens for authenticated API requests.
4. **Request Authentication** - All API requests must include appropriate authentication headers.

## Partner Registration

Partners must be registered in the Parchment system before they can access the API. This is typically done by the Parchment team. Once registered, partners receive:

- A unique `x-partner-id`
- A `x-partner-secret` for authentication

## Organization Registration

Once a new organization is created, the partner will receive a `x-organization-id` and `x-organization-secret` for authentication. This secret is used to generate a JWT token for authenticated API requests.

## Token Generation

Partners must generate a JWT token for authenticated API requests. Tokens have the following characteristics:

- Valid for 1 hour
- Include specific scopes that determine permissions
- Are signed using RS256 algorithm
- Used as Bearer token in the Authorization header
  - eg. `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Security Considerations

- Partner and Organization secrets should be kept secure on serverside and never exposed publicly
- Tokens have a limited lifetime of 1 hour
- Use HTTPS for all API requests
- Implement proper error handling for authentication failures

## API Reference

For detailed API endpoints and request/response formats, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/token).
