# Partner Token Creation

This guide explains how Parchment validates partner authentication tokens and how to implement proper token creation in your applications.

## Token Structure

Parchment uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with the RS256 algorithm for partner authentication. JWT tokens consist of three parts:

1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the token type and signing algorithm
2. **Payload**: Contains claims about the entity (partner) and additional data
3. **Signature**: Ensures the token hasn't been altered

## Token Payload

A typical token payload contains:

```json
{
  "organization_id": "ORG456",
  "partner_id": "PARTNER123",
  "user_id": "USER789",
  "scope": ["read:patients", "write:prescriptions"],
  "iat": 1682506249,
  "exp": 1682509849
}
```

| Field             | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `organization_id` | Unique identifier for the organization           |
| `partner_id`      | Unique identifier for the partner                |
| `user_id`         | Identifier for the end-user (if applicable)      |
| `scope`           | Array of permission scopes granted to this token |
| `iat`             | Issued At - timestamp when the token was created |
| `exp`             | Expiration - timestamp when the token expires    |

## Validation Process

When validating a partner token, our API performs the following checks:

1. **Organization ID Check**: Verifies the organization ID in the request path/params matches the one in the token
2. **Signature Verification**: Validates the token signature using the appropriate public key
3. **Expiration Check**: Ensures the token has not expired
4. **Scope Check**: Confirms the token includes the required scope for the requested operation
5. **Organization Secret Check**: Validates the provided organization secret matches our records

## Required Headers

For successful authentication, API requests must include these headers:

```
x-organization-secret: your_organization_secret
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1...
```

## JWKS Endpoint

Parchment provides a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint that serves the public keys needed to verify token signatures. This follows standard OAuth 2.0 practices for key rotation and management.

## Error Responses

When token validation fails, you'll receive an error response with HTTP status code 401 or 403 and a message explaining the reason:

| Status | Error                   | Description                                            |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 401    | `invalid_token`         | The token is malformed or has an invalid signature     |
| 401    | `expired_token`         | The token has expired                                  |
| 403    | `insufficient_scope`    | The token does not have the required scope             |
| 403    | `organization_mismatch` | Organization ID in the request doesn't match the token |
| 401    | `invalid_secret`        | The organization secret is invalid                     |

## Best Practices

- Always verify tokens on the server-side, never in client-side code
- Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
- Use a token management library that handles JWT validation correctly
- Don't store tokens in local storage or cookies accessible by JavaScript
- Implement token refresh logic to handle expiration gracefully
